## A Tattoo App

**Welcome dear developers ðŸ‘¾** 

This is the repository for my capstone project "Wannado"

### The basic Idea of the app:
- Users can browse random wanadoos, i.e. small tattoo-ideas. They can filter them by location, price etc.
- Users can visit the pages of the tattoo artist and see their time schedule for making an appointment
- Users can also see map with tattoo artists near them
- Tattoo artists can create a profile and upload their wannados
- Tattoo artists can pubilsh their time schedule, so making appointments is easy for both sides

### Pull Requests
You are also welcome to directly review my Code. Check the open [PR's](https://github.com/onebarloop/wannado/pulls). Since this is the first time I'm using typescript in an application, I am very happy about tips regarding the correct usage of types.


**Have a wonderful day** ðŸ¦„
