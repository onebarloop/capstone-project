**Welcome dear developers ðŸ‘¾**

### The basic Idea of the app:
- Users can browse random wannados, i.e. small tattoo-ideas. They can filter them by location, price etc.
- Users can visit the pages of the tattoo artist and see their time schedule for making an appointment
- Users can also see map with tattoo artists near them
- Tattoo artists can create a profile and upload their wannados
- Tattoo artists can publish their time schedule, so making appointments is easy for both sides
- Tattoo artists can upload their sketches and tattoo-ideas, so users can browse them

### Pull Requests
You are also welcome to directly review my Code. Check the open [PR's](https://github.com/onebarloop/wannado/pulls). Since this is the first time I'm using typescript in an application, I am very happy about tips regarding the correct usage of types. If you are not familiar with typescript, nevertheless please review my code! You can easily recognize typescript in my code via the corresponding comments or the inline type specification (foo: type).


**Have a wonderful day** ðŸ¦„
